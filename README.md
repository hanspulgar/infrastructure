# README
This repo intends to help anyone to devolop or improve the infrastructure.

Here, you'll find some infrastructure resources that can be easily deployed in your AWS account in order to automate some processes.

At this moment, I'm developing most of resources in [Cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) for infrastructure and [Python](https://www.python.org/) for scripting.

Feel free to contact me if you would like me to develop a solution for you.
